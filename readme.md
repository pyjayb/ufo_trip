## UFO Trip Game
#### This is my second experience creating a game with pygame. It is a simple, dodge objects falling on you kind of game. It's still ongoing, but it can already be played if you have python 3 on your PC
### Getting Started
#### Clone or download it, then run on python, with pygame in your venv. When I finish it, I will make an executable file
### Prerequisites
#### You just need Python3 and Pygame installed on your venv
